    </h1>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;"> Philip Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served <br> in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American <br> microbiologist.[5]

        <span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana; size: 25;"> <b>Court case and the denial of degree</b> </span>
    </h1>
    <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana;size: 1;;"> Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external <br> examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the <br> university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of <br> Appeals.[8]
